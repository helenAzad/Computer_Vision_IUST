## Exercise 1: Grayscale Image Quantization

**Task**: Given a grayscale image with pixel intensity values ranging from 4 to 122, quantize the image to 40 levels. Determine the new intensity range and discuss the impact on image quality.

**Solution**:
- The new intensity range will be determined.
- The effect on image quality will be analyzed and explained.

## Exercise 2: Capturing a Clear Image of a Bird in Flight

**Task**: Suggest an appropriate shutter speed to capture a sharp image of a bird in flight and explain the reasoning.

**Solution**:
- Recommended shutter speed with an explanation based on motion blur and freezing action.

## Exercise 3: Photographing a High-Speed Cheetah Chase

**Task**: Provide suggestions for a wildlife photographer to improve the quality of a photo capturing a cheetah chase, including shutter speed, depth of field, and field of view.

**Solution**:
- Detailed recommendations covering optimal settings for capturing fast motion and achieving desired focus and composition.

## Exercise 4: Introduction to OpenCV

**Tasks**:
1. Compare the display differences between OpenCV and Matplotlib.
2. Perform various image manipulations:
   - Vertically concatenate the original image with its vertical flip.
   - Vertically concatenate the vertical flip with the original image.
   - Horizontally concatenate the original image with its horizontal flip.
   - Horizontally concatenate the horizontal flip with the original image.
3. Change the color of a window in the Computer Science Faculty building image.
4. Display and analyze each color channel of the IUST logo.

**Solution**:
- Notebooks demonstrating the use of OpenCV for image processing tasks.
- Images showing concatenated and color-modified results.
- Analysis of each color channel in the IUST logo.

## How to Run the Notebooks

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/helenAzad/Computer_Vision_IUST.git
    cd Computer_Vision_IUST
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

4. Run Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Open and run the provided notebooks:
    - `Basic.ipynb`
    - `Numpy.ipynb`
    - `Introduction_to_OpenCV.ipynb`

## Notebooks Overview

### Basic.ipynb and Numpy.ipynb

These notebooks are intended to familiarize you with Python and NumPy. Ensure you understand each section, as you will need to demonstrate your proficiency during the presentation.

### Introduction_to_OpenCV.ipynb

This notebook introduces OpenCV's capabilities, including reading, displaying, and manipulating images. Follow the tasks outlined in the notebook and provide answers to the specified questions.
